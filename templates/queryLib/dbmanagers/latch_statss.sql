This SQL*PLUS script reports on some latch get and miss rates.

"% of gets" is the % of latch gets which were for this latch.

% of misses" is the % of latch misses which were for this latch.

"Miss rate %" is the % of time a request for this latch did not 
succeed on the first try.

"spin succ %" is the %age of time that the latch could be got 
within the first spin_count tries

"Avg sleeps" is the average number of sleeps which occured once the 
latch could not be obtained after trying spin_lock times.

"Waits holding%" is the %age of times a process held the latch and went into a wait state.

prompt Notes:
prompt -------------------------------------------------------------------;
prompt
prompt Miss rates and Sleep rates should be less that 1% generally,  although
prompt higher rates may not matter if the latch accounts for a very small 
prompt %age of latch gets
prompt
prompt To reduce contention for the redo allocation latch;
prompt try creating more latches (LOG_SIMULTANEOUS_COPIES)
prompt up to 2xCPU_COUNT.  If this fails,  try forcing 
prompt pre-build of redo entries by upping 
prompt LOG_ENTRY_PREBUILD_THRESHOLD
prompt
prompt To reduce contention for library cache latch,  reduce dynamic SQL.
prompt In 7.2,  consider increasing _kgl_latch_copies
prompt
prompt To reduce contention for the cache buffers lru chain,  increase 
prompt _db_block_hash_buckets and/or reduce physical reads by increasing 
prompt db_block_buffers.  ORACLE 7.3 has multiple lru chain latches.
prompt 
prompt Increasing spin count may reduce latch free waits in V$SYSTEM_EVENT
prompt and may increase the spin succ% rate shown above at the cost of 
prompt increased CPU utilisation.
